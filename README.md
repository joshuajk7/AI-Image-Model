# ML-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Image-Model | Detectable Rock Paper Scissors Against an AI 

## Getting Started 
Add keras_model.h5 and labels.txt files to the jupyter project. Take an image using the webcam, file will be saved as photo.jpg. 

To implement your own trainable image model, use the Teachable Machine link and export > TensorFlow > Keras (Model conversion type).

## Description
This Rock Paper Scissors Game uses a webcam image of the users 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' hand gestures against the random bot opponents move. 

This python / js project imports a trained keras.h5 image model made from Teachable Image by Google, and is used for differentiating and categorizing the hand gestures of 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors'. A predictability score of the image class is given.
