# AI-Image-Model | Detectable Rock Paper Scissors Against an AI 

## Description
This Rock Paper Scissors Game uses a webcam image of the users 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' hand gestures against the random bot opponents move. 

This python / js project imports a trained keras.h5 image model made from Teachable Image by Google, and is used for differentiating and categorizing the hand gestures of 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors'. A predictability score of the image class is given.
